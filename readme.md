# Updated Portfolio Page - Homework 08

## Description

This is the Bootstrap/Project 1 Update to my personal portfolio. I have revised the look of the page entirely from Homework 02, encorporating modern Bootstrap design as well as all the CSS tricks I have learned in the last month so a potential employer can see my work and samples, as well as resume and links to all social and professional contact profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn)
